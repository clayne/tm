Single-file libraries for C/C++ in public domain.

Current libraries

Library | Desciption | Language | Current Version
--- | --- | --- | ---
tm_arrayview.h | Lightweight ArrayView and UninitializedArrayView classes for POD types, allows treating static arrays and memory regions like std containers with insertion/erase. No memory allocation/resizing, does not own memory. | C++11 | v1.1.6
tm_bezier.h | Calculate bezier curve points with forward differencing using only floating point addition | C99/C++ | v1.1
tm_bin_packing.h | C port with minor modifications of the Guillotine and MaxRects algorithms originally written by [Jukka Jyl√§nki](https://github.com/juj/RectangleBinPack) (also public domain) | C99/C++ | v1.0.6
tm_cli.h | Commandline parser that is similar to getopt_long, but doesn't rely on globals and very lightweight. | C99/C++ | v0.1
tm_conversion.h | From and to string conversion library with minimal dependencies. | C99/C++ | v0.9.9.5
tm_json.h | C++ and C99 json parsing library that can do both json reading and parsing into a json document for queries. Accepts a wide variety of flags, can be used to parse json in strict mode, or in json5 mode with the right combination of flags. | C99/C++ | v0.1.5
tm_polygon.h | Triangulation and clipping of polygons. Clipping supports union, difference and substraction. | C99/C++ | v1.1
tm_print.h | Lightweight typesafe variadic print and snprint using C++11 and variadic templates. | C++11 | v0.0.8
tm_stringutil.h | String utility functions, from matching, comparison to tokenizing. | C99/C++ | v0.2
tm_unicode.h | Extracting codepoints from utf8/utf16 strings and conversion between them. | C99/C++ | v1.0.1a
tm_utility.h | Utility and convenience functions, mainly for my personal use. | C++11 | v1.1.4

These libraries follow the same guidelines as [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb).
They have minimal dependencies and are dual licensed in both the public domain and MIT.
